# Formidably Asked Questions

## What's wrong with pageviews?

A pageview is a measure that indicates a person loaded the URL for a webpage on a browser. This is fine in and of itself. It becomes a problem when this information becomes overvalued as a decision-making tool â€” for example, when it is extrapolated as a proxy to indicate people read and interacted with a piece of journalism. Since many newsrooms do this, insights about performance are obscured behind the pageview facade.

## How can I contribute to this project?

[Tell us](http://twitter.com/theCarebot) what metrics you are using or want to use in your work to help us define, prioritize and develop the measures and indicators Carebots is able to track and report on. It is early to contribute code, but we'll welcome all contributions past May 2016 when we complete our public prototype.
